## Punk Editors

**Being a Punk Editor is an oxymoron.** Punks emerged from the bottom of the social pyramid; Editors are respected citizens. Punks reject dogmas and question what is established; Editors have been discoverers, but also censors and ultimately decide what should be published. Punks have an independent and countercultural attitude; Editors have social leverage and help to build up cultural constructs; Punks create minimalist compositions, often simple and raw, and sometimes careless; Editors are detail-oriented and perfectionists. Punks want to destroy; Editors to curate.

These contrasting realities perfectly reflect the tension between the despair we feel towards the actual academic publishing system with the will to produce and discover robust science. As Punk Editors we see *No future* in academic publishing, but we want *to bring forth* solid ideas. 

This organization aims to use the power of information technology to self-publish high-quality open, reproducible science bypassing the actual publishing system. 

> Punk is the constant struggle against fear of social repercussions. *Greg Graffin (Bad Religion singer and Ph.D. in evolution)*
